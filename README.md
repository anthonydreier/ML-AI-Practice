ML & AI Practice

This repository contains my personal notes, code, and exercises while learning the foundations of machine learning and AI, based on the Machine Learning playlist by Codebasics (Dhaval Patel).

What's Included

    Follow-along implementations of core ML algorithms and concepts

    My own solutions and interpretations of the assignment exercises

    Exploratory notebooks with experimentation and tweaks

    Python-based code using scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, and matplotlib

Each topic is organized in its own directory. The /Exercise folder within each topic contains my personal solutions to the exercises from that video.

This self-study effort is part of my preparation for contributing to an applied machine learning research project under faculty supervision at Florida Polytechnic University, with the goal of eventually exploring deep learning.
